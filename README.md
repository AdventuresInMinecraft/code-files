## Description

This is all of the code files for the book "Adventures in Minecraft, 2nd Edition".

The files are split into folders, 1 for each adventure.

## How to use

 1. Download and open the code-files.zip file.
 2. Open the Adventure folder for the code file you need. 
 3. Copy the `py` file you need to the `AdventuresInMinecaft/MyAdventures` folder on your Desktop.
 4. Open the `py` file using IDLE.

NOTE - You should always copy the code files to the MyAdventures folder 
and run it from there as the programs will need the API's and libraries which are held 
in the MyAdventures/mcpi and MyAdventures/bitio folders.
